The following is a comprehensive overview of the available options in the Test ROC module. For information on getting started, see here:

`r list_pages(nickname = "testROCFintroduction")`

## Calculations

The TestROC module is built on top of "cutpointR", which is a well-documented R package by Christian Thiele [LINK]. As such, the best documentation on the calculations performed by any of the options below is found in the cutpointR package documentation. In addition, any requests for changes in the way calculations are performed are best directed to cutpointR. If/when they are implemented there, the TestROC package will be automatically updated.

## Options

### 1. title: Dependent Variable      type: Variables


### 2. Class Variable      type: Variable


### 3. Group Variable      type: Variable

### 4. Method
      options: 
        Custom cut score
        Maximize metric
        Minimize metric
        Maximize metric (LOESS)
        Minimize metric (LOESS)
        Maximize metric (spline)
        Minimize metric (spline)
        Maximize metric (boot)
        Minimize metric (boot)
        Maximize Youden-Index (Kernel smoothed)
        Maximize Youden-Index (Parametric normal)
        default: maximize_metric

`Method` determines how the optimal cutpoint will be determined after calculating the `Metric` (below). The default is simply `Maximize Metric`, which means that the cutpoint with the maximum value for `Metric` will be chosen as the optimal cutpoint. The options in brackets, `LOESS`, `spline`, `boot`, `Kernel smoothed`, and `Parametric normal` refer to different smoothing operations which may be carried out on the metric prior to selecting the respective max/min value.

### 5. All observed scores

If `All observed scores` is selected, results table will return statistics for all observed measure scores in the data.
      
### 6. Specify cut score      type: String

`Specify cut score` will be ignored unless the `Custom Cut Score` option for `Method` (above) is chosen. This option is used to return only the results for a single specified observed score.

### 7. Metric      type: List
      options:
        Sum Sens-Spec
        Accuracy
        Youden-Index
        Sum: Sens/Spec
        Sum: PPV/NPV
        Prod: Sens/Spec
        Prod: PPV/NPV
        Cohen's Kappa
        Abs. d: Sens/Spec
        ROC
        Abs. d: PPV/NPV
        Chi-squared
        Odds Ratio
        Risk Ratio
        Misclassification Cost
        Total Utility
        F1 score
        
`Metric` refers to the statistic/value that is to be calculated and used by `Method` for selecting the optimal cutpoint(s).

### 8. Bootstrap runs      type: Number

### 9. Ties
      options:
        All optimal cutpoints
        Mean optimal cutpoint
        Median optimal cutpoint

### 10. Direction (relative to optimal cutpoint)
      options:
        ">="
        "<="

### 11. ROC
      default: True

### 12. Standard error bars
      default: True

### 13. LOESS Smoothing
      default: True

### 14. Sensitivity-Specificity Tables
      default: False
