**Binary Differential Item Functioning** module of the PsychoPDA suite for jamovi

<img src="DIF/main.png  " class="img-responsive" alt="">

The module provides an interface for performing differential item functioning (DIF) analysis on dichotomously scored items with a binary grouping variable, with options to perform design analysis and view item characteristic curves.

# Module

The DIF module performs DIF analysis on dichotomously scored items using binary grouping variables(fn) and either total-score matching or matching based on a supplied variable. The following explanation of the analysis will use an example where the grouping variable β₁ is a binary classification (0, 1) and the matching variable is a latent construct-level variable θ. This example is the case where we are simultaneously assessing for both uniform or non-uniform DIF.

Using a GLIM model, items are fit first with a baseline model containing both the main effects and interaction effect:

Logit of endorsement = β₀ + β₁ + θ + (β₁ * θ)

A second model containing  only the main effect of the matching variable is then fit:

Logit of endorsement = β₀ + θ 

The reduction in model deviance is then calculated between the baseline and secondary models (ΔD). If ΔD is not statistically significant (at a level specifiable by the user and using either the Wald test of joint significance or a likelihood ratio test), then the item is not exhibiting DIF. If ΔD is significant, the item is flagged as exhibiting DIF and the effect size for ΔD may be assessed.

# Descriptive Overview

Upon loading the module, the instsructions below will be displayed, indicating the minimum requirements for beginning an analysis.

Once the variables have been set, the instructions are replaced with a descriptive overview of the analysis.
