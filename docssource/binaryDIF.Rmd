**Binary Differential Item Functioning** module of the PsychoPDA suite for jamovi

<img src="DIF/main.png  " class="img-responsive" alt="">

The module provides an interface for performing differential item functioning (DIF) analysis on dichotomously scored items with a binary grouping variable, with options to perform design analysis and view item characteristic curves.

# Module

The DIF module performs DIF analysis on dichotomously scored items using binary grouping variables(fn) and either total-score matching or matching based on a supplied variable. The following explanation of the analysis will use an example where the grouping variable β₁ is a binary classification (0, 1) and the matching variable is a latent construct-level variable θ. This example is the case where we are simultaneously assessing for both uniform or non-uniform DIF.

Using a GLIM model, items are fit first with a baseline model containing both the main effects and interaction effect:

Logit of endorsement = β₀ + β₁ + θ + (β₁ * θ)

A second model containing  only the main effect of the matching variable is then fit:

Logit of endorsement = β₀ + θ 

The reduction in model deviance is then calculated between the baseline and secondary models (ΔD). If ΔD is not statistically significant (at a level specifiable by the user and using either the Wald test of joint significance or a likelihood ratio test), then the item is not exhibiting DIF. If ΔD is significant, the item is flagged as exhibiting DIF.
